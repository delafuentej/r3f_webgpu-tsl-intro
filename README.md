# F1 Ferrari Racing Driver Winner - 3D Scene

This project showcases a 3D scene of a winning Ferrari F1 racing driver created using React Three Fiber, leveraging the latest WebGPU renderer and Three Shading Language (TSL). It is built with Vite and features advanced post-processing effects.

## Features

- Custom materials using Three Shading Language (TSL)
- WebGPU renderer integration with WebGL fallback for broad compatibility
- Post-processing effects to enhance visual quality
- React Three Fiber (R3F) for declarative 3D scene construction
- Interactive controls and performance optimizations

## Conclusion

- How to customize materials using TSL, how to use the new WebGPU renderer, and how to add post-processing effects.

**Be careful, the WebGPU API but also Three.js implementation of it are not in their final form yet. Some features may change in the future and lead to breaking changes.**

**While we have seen React Three Fiber is compatible with WebGPU, not all Drei components are ported yet. Actually, all the ones relying on custom shaders. The most notable one is the Html component.**
